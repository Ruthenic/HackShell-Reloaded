# HS:RE is dead. See below for details
Please check out the new rewrite if on Linux, simushell. Here's the old one.


HackShell-Reloaded (stylized as HS:RE) is a replacement command proccesser/shell for Windows written in C#.

Why making a new HS:RE repo instead of updating the previous one? No reason for the viewer! Mainly I got a new PC (and basically merged original Hackshell (OGHS) and original HackShell Bleeding Edge/Early Access (private) code.) Don't bother with the old one unless someone forks it btw, it is much more limited (you can't even use cd .. come on old me)

Warnings:
1. The releases section is most likely out of date, for checking out the newest up to date commits, please see HackShell-Reloaded\HackShell\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\HackShell.exe for newest builds post non-release commit.


I think thats all. Enjoy!
